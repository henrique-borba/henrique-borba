I am Henrique Borba 😃. I am from Brasília, Brazil and I am the current maintainer of the project NumPower for PHP. I'm a machine learning enthusiast and a generalist engineer currently focused on learning more about deep learning by creating projects from scratch for the PHP ecosystem based on famous Python libraries.

* NumPower Autograd (https://github.com/NumPower/numpower-autograd)
## ⚡ My work style and philosophy
- The languages ​​I like and work with are **C, C#, Python and PHP**.
- I can do **Java**, but my tolerance is low so I overdose quickly.
- I have no preference for web frameworks and would use any that have dependency injection, a router, middleware support and **documentation**.
- I prefer raw queries than ORM's 😃.
- I'm passionate about backend and library development.
